# Simple Calculator with GUI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first group project I worked on in my Altschool Africa Data Science track. This project is a simple calculator that use **tkinter** as the GUI module. The calculator is able to perform basic calculations like addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. You can also clear or delete inputs on the display.
